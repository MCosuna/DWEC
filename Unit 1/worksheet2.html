    <p>3. The Geometrizer
            Calculate properties of a circle, searching the internet for definitions if not remember.
            
            Store a radius into a variable.
            Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
            Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".</p>

            4. The Temperature Converter
            It's hot out! Let's make a converter, and again you'll have to search the internet how to do it.
            
            Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
            Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
            Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
            Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
